For these example scenes to work, you need to follow this procedure:

- Import PlayMaker

- Import NGUI

- Get the the ScoreFlash NGUI package from the Unity Asset Store: 
  In Unity's menu: Help / narayana games / ScoreFlash Addons / NGUI

- Get the the ScoreFlash PlayMaker package from the Unity Asset Store: 
  In Unity's menu: Help / narayana games / ScoreFlash Addons / PlayMaker

With all of these imported, the 4 examples will work just fine and use NGUI 
together with PlayMaker. If any of those is missing, you'll be getting error 
messages.
